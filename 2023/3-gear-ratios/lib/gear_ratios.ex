  The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently any number adjacent to a symbol, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (.) do not count as a symbol.)

  Here is an example engine schematic:

  467..114..
  ...*......
  ..35..633.
  ......#...
  617*......
  .....+.58.
  ..592.....
  ......755.
  ...$.*....
  .664.598..

  In this schematic, two numbers are not part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: 114 (top right) and 58 (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so is a part number; their sum is 4361.
